This is simply a front end Blazor calculator using the British Dressage score sheet calculation metrics.  The Blazor element is for calculating scores manually.  I am working towards using Azure Ai Document Intelligence to read score sheets from an image and 
verify the scores.  Unaffiliated dressage has no league or ranking system and I'd like to develop a system which enables that.
